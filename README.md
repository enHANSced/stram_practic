# stram_practic

A new Flutter project.

The objective of this project is to develop a Flutter application that uses Streams to provide data to a dynamic ListView using StreamBuilder and ListView.builder.

This code creates a StreamController<String> and configures it to emit new items every 2 seconds. The StreamBuilder is used to subscribe to the Stream created by the StreamController. The StreamBuilder has a builder that is called every time a new item is received in the Stream. The builder is used to create the UI that will show the emitted data.
